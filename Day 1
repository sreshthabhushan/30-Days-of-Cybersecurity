🔐 Day 1 of #30DaysOfCybersecurity
Today, I kicked off my cybersecurity journey by diving into the Pre-Security learning path on TryHackMe — a beginner-friendly track designed to build a strong foundation in cybersecurity concepts.

🔍 What I Learned:

🚩 Offensive Security
Offensive security focuses on simulating real-world attacks to uncover vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.
I explored how Red Teams and penetration testers perform tasks like:
- Breaking into systems
- Exploiting software bugs
- Identifying loopholes in applications

In the lab section, I used Virtual Machines to simulate a secure environment and tested my skills by attacking a mock bank application called Fakebank — a safe way to experience hands-on ethical hacking.

🛡️ Defensive Security
On the flip side, I also learned about Defensive Security, which involves:
- Preventing and detecting intrusions
- Responding effectively to security incidents

Key defensive tasks include:
- Promoting user cybersecurity awareness
- Asset documentation and management
- System updates and patching
- Setting up firewalls, IDS/IPS, and monitoring systems

🔐 Deep Dive into Defensive Subfields:

🏢 Security Operations Center (SOC)
A SOC is the heart of an organization's cyber defense — monitoring networks and systems for malicious events like vulnerabilities, policy violations, and unauthorized activities.
I learned how SOCs use SIEM tools to gather logs and generate alerts for potential threats, giving analysts a unified view of the security posture.

🧠 Threat Intelligence
Threat intelligence involves collecting information on potential adversaries to build a threat-informed defense. It helps organizations anticipate attacks and stay a step ahead of cyber threats.

🕵️‍♂️ Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
Digital Forensics investigates the aftermath of an attack — tracing data breaches, IP theft, and unauthorized access through logs, memory, and file analysis.

Incident Response follows a structured 4-phase process:
- Preparation
- Detection & Analysis
- Containment, Eradication & Recovery
- Post-Incident Review

🦠 Malware Analysis
I explored two key types of malware analysis:
 Static Analysis: Examining malware code without execution
 Dynamic Analysis: Running malware in a sandbox to monitor its behavior

🧪 Lab Experience
As a simulated SOC Analyst, I worked with a SIEM tool to analyze alerts and detect suspicious activity in a virtual banking environment. This hands-on exercise tied everything together — from threat detection to response.
