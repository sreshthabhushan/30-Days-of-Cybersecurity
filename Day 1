### 🔐 Day 1 of #30DaysOfCybersecurity
Today, I kicked off my cybersecurity journey by diving into the Pre-Security learning path on TryHackMe — a beginner-friendly track designed to build a strong foundation in cybersecurity concepts.

*🔍 What I Learned:*

*🚩 Offensive Security*
Offensive security focuses on simulating real-world attacks to uncover vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.
I explored how Red Teams and penetration testers perform tasks like:
Breaking into systems
Exploiting software bugs
Identifying loopholes in applications

In the lab section, I used Virtual Machines to simulate a secure environment and tested my skills by attacking a mock bank application called Fakebank — a safe way to experience hands-on ethical hacking.

*🛡️ Defensive Security*
On the flip side, I also learned about Defensive Security, which involves:
Preventing and detecting intrusions
Responding effectively to security incidents

Key defensive tasks include:
Promoting user cybersecurity awareness
Asset documentation and management
System updates and patching
Setting up firewalls, IDS/IPS, and monitoring systems

*🔐 Deep Dive into Defensive Subfields:*

*🏢 Security Operations Center (SOC)*
A SOC is the heart of an organization's cyber defense — monitoring networks and systems for malicious events like vulnerabilities, policy violations, and unauthorized activities.
I learned how SOCs use SIEM tools to gather logs and generate alerts for potential threats, giving analysts a unified view of the security posture.

*🧠 Threat Intelligence*
Threat intelligence involves collecting information on potential adversaries to build a threat-informed defense. It helps organizations anticipate attacks and stay a step ahead of cyber threats.

*🕵️‍♂️ Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)*
Digital Forensics investigates the aftermath of an attack — tracing data breaches, IP theft, and unauthorized access through logs, memory, and file analysis.

Incident Response follows a structured 4-phase process:
Preparation
Detection & Analysis
Containment, Eradication & Recovery
Post-Incident Review

*🦠 Malware Analysis*
I explored two key types of malware analysis:
 Static Analysis: Examining malware code without execution
 Dynamic Analysis: Running malware in a sandbox to monitor its behavior

🧪 Lab Experience
As a simulated SOC Analyst, I worked with a SIEM tool to analyze alerts and detect suspicious activity in a virtual banking environment. This hands-on exercise tied everything together — from threat detection to response.
