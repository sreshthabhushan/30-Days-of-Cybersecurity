🌐 Day 2 of #30DaysOfCybersecurity
Today, I explored one of the most fundamental concepts in cybersecurity — Networking — through the Pre-Security path on TryHackMe. 🔍

🧠 Key Concepts Covered:

💻 What is Networking?
Networking refers to the connection of devices — from just two to billions — allowing them to communicate and share data.
These devices include everything from laptops and smartphones to traffic lights, security cameras, and even smart farming tools!
Because networks are so deeply embedded in our daily lives — from weather monitoring to electricity delivery — understanding networking is crucial in cybersecurity.

🌍 What is the Internet?
The Internet as we know it began with the ARPANET project in the 1960s, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web, shaping the modern Internet.
The Internet is essentially a network of networks:
- Private Networks: Internal networks within homes, businesses, etc.
- Public Networks: The global web of connected private networks, a.k.a. the Internet!

🆔 Identifying Devices on a Network
To ensure smooth communication, every device on a network needs a unique identity. Devices are identified using two main components:

 1️⃣ IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)
 Temporarily identifies a device on a network.
 Can be private (within a local network) or public (visible on the Internet).
 Governed by protocols that standardize communication between devices.

 2️⃣ MAC Address (Media Access Control Address)
 A permanent, hardware-based identifier assigned during manufacturing.
 A 12-character hexadecimal value (e.g., 00:1A:C2:7B:00:47).
 Can be spoofed — a technique used in attacks to impersonate another device.

🧪 Lab Experience: MAC Spoofing in Action
In a simulated hotel Wi-Fi network, only paid users were allowed to access the Internet:
- Alice’s packets (green) were allowed through because she paid
- Bob’s packets (blue) were blocked
💡 By spoofing Bob's MAC address to match Alice’s, I was able to bypass access control — showcasing how weak MAC-based restrictions can be manipulated.

📶 Ping & ICMP
I also explored the use of Ping, one of the most fundamental network tools.
Ping works by sending ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to check whether a connection between two devices exists and how reliable it is.

🛠️ It’s as simple as running:
    ping [IP address or URL]

In the lab, I pinged 8.8.8.8 (Google’s DNS server) to check connectivity — and revealed a hidden flag 🎯.

✅ Takeaway:
Today I learned how devices communicate on networks, how they’re identified, and how easily weak implementations can be exploited. Networking truly forms the backbone of cybersecurity, and understanding these basics is crucial for spotting and preventing threats.
